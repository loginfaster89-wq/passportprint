# Studio Print — Devin skill (condensed recipe)

Short checklist for Devin sessions on `loginfaster89-wq/passportprint`.
Deeper context lives in `AGENTS.md` at the repo root — read that file too,
this is just the "what do I run, what do I avoid" cheat sheet.

## 0. Vision — DO NOT DELETE

**This section defines how Devin approaches every task on Studio Print.
Read it first, internalise it, and let it guide every decision.**

Studio Print ka goal hai ki jab bhi koi user is website par aaye, toh
wo **bhool na paaye**. Design, fonts, visuals, micro-interactions,
layout, spacing — **sab kuch next level** hona chahiye. Ye ek indie
tool nahi hai — ye ek **2026 ka top-tier product** hai aur aise dikhna
chahiye.

**Devin ka role:** Devin ne is website ko banane mein actively help ki
hai. Devin sirf code nahi likhta — wo **design quality ka co-owner** hai.
Har PR mein:
- Existing design tokens (`--accent`, `--surface`, `--border`, etc.) ko
  **maximum effect** ke liye use karo.
- Har element ka spacing, alignment, aur visual weight check karo.
- Responsive behaviour har viewport pe polished hona chahiye — phone se
  desktop tak.
- Micro-interactions (hover, focus, transitions) subtle aur consistent
  hone chahiye.
- Copy terse, confident, non-salesy honi chahiye.

**Bottom line:** Jab tak website "wow" na lage, kaam khatam nahi hua.
Ye section kabhi delete mat karo — ye Devin ka design compass hai.

## 1. Clone & build

```bash
# Clone (PAT is already a repo-scoped secret: GITHUB_PAT_PASSPORTPRINT)
git clone "https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_PAT_PASSPORTPRINT}@github.com/loginfaster89-wq/passportprint.git"
cd passportprint
npm install
npm run build              # minified + obfuscated → ./dist
npx http-server dist -p 8080
# or: python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory dist
```

No dev server — edit source, `npm run build`, preview from `dist/`.
`npm run clean` removes `dist/`.

## 2. Hard rules (do NOT break these)

1. **`passport-photo.html` is editable — but minimum-diff only.** 5000+
   line working feature with its own inline copies of nav / auth / header
   plus a hash-open script (`#plans`, `#buy-<planId>`). Shared-module
   changes elsewhere must stay compatible with those inline copies.
   (Previously locked, unlocked 2026-04-24 at the owner's request —
   PR #109 U1 buy-flow was the first approved edit.)
2. **Never edit `.github/workflows/*.yml`** unless user confirms the PAT
   has `Actions: Read and write` (default fine-grained PAT only has
   Contents + Pull requests).
3. **Fonts, palette, CSS tokens are locked.** `Syne` (headings), `DM Mono`
   (body), `--bg: #0D0D0D`, `--accent: #F0A500`, etc. Use the existing
   vars in `assets/legal.css`; don't add new colour/spacing tokens.
4. **One PR per logical task, minimum diff.** No drive-by refactors.
5. **No secrets in commits.** Razorpay keys, Google OAuth secrets,
   `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_PAT_*` all live only in GitHub /
   Render settings.
6. **Shared header/nav/auth** = `assets/legal.css`, `assets/nav.js`,
   `assets/auth.js`, `assets/auth.css`. Don't fork into per-page copies.
7. **Pricing numbers** (free: 2 sheets/day; weekly: ₹59/7 days; monthly:
   ₹149/30 days) appear in `index.html`, `terms.html`, `refund.html`,
   `shipping.html`. If one changes, update all four.
8. **Design / fonts / animations / effects = case-by-case approval
   (2026-04-24).** Project owner wants top-tier 2026 polish, but any new
   font, palette, token, animation, transition, hover effect, decorative
   element, or layout restructuring requires **explicit owner approval
   in-thread before the PR opens**. Modern motion / micro-interactions
   are welcome *within* the existing tokens — but ask first. Minor
   spacing / responsive fixes from `issues.md` do not need per-change
   approval.

## 3. Create a PR (fine-grained PAT flow)

`git_pr` / `list_repos` often return "Not Found" because the session's
GitHub user isn't the repo owner. Fall back to REST with the PAT:

```bash
# After commit + push
cat > /tmp/pr_body.json <<'JSON'
{
  "title": "Short, present-tense summary",
  "head": "devin/<timestamp>-<slug>",
  "base": "main",
  "body": "## What\n...\n\n## Why\n...\n\n## Change\n...\n\n## Scope\n..."
}
JSON

curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_PAT_PASSPORTPRINT" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/pr_body.json \
  https://api.github.com/repos/loginfaster89-wq/passportprint/pulls
```

Branch convention: `devin/<unix-timestamp>-<short-slug>`.

## 4. Deploy

- **Primary:** Cloudflare Pages, project name `studioprint`.
  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` on every `main` push:
  `npm ci` → `npm run build` → `wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=studioprint`.
- **Fallback:** Netlify (`netlify.toml`).
- CF Pages statuses don't post back to PRs. To verify:
  `curl https://studioprint.pages.dev` — prod URL propagation 10–60s;
  per-deploy hash URL is instant.
- Manual `wrangler` fallback: see `CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOY.md`.

## 5. 2026 copy tone (post PR #61)

- Hero: **"Every print job. One browser tab."** (accent on second line)
- Eyebrow: `ON-DEVICE AI · BUILT IN INDIA · NEW IN 2026`
- CTA heading: "Your next print job — right in this tab."
- Passport-photo page title + plan tags refreshed to match.
- English only — Hindi copy was removed site-wide in PR #60.

Keep future copy in that same confident, terse, non-salesy register.

## 6. Homepage grid → slider behaviour (post PR #64 / #65)

`assets/sliders.js` (plain, not obfuscated) adds `.is-slider` to
`.why-grid`, `.features-grid`, `.audience-grid`, `.steps-grid` when:
- viewport ≤ 760px, **or**
- any row has an orphan (right edge trails widest row by > 10px).

If you touch that script, smoke-test at 820px (iPad Air), 1280px
(desktop), 375px (iPhone SE). 820px must show 1 row + 4 dots; 1280px
must show plain grid; 375px must show slider.

## 7. Shared header layout (post PR #54 / #66)

```html
<header class="legal-header">
  <a href="index.html" class="logo">Studio <em>Print</em></a>
  <nav id="primaryNav">…links…</nav>
  <button class="nav-login" id="hdrAuthBtn">Login</button>
  <button class="nav-toggle" aria-controls="primaryNav">☰</button>
</header>
```

`#hdrAuthBtn` sits **outside** `<nav>` so Login is visible beside the
☰ on mobile without expanding the drawer. At ≤900px `<nav>` becomes
`position:absolute` — only `.nav-login` gets `margin-left:auto`;
`.nav-toggle` is explicitly `margin-left:0` so both pin right together
(PR #66 fix — was previously splitting flex free space between them
and centering the Login button).

`passport-photo.html` has its own inline copy of this CSS — don't try
to dedupe it from here.

## 7b. Shared pricing module (post PR #114)

`assets/pricing.js` + `assets/pricing.css` — shared 2-step modal:
Choose Plan → Complete Payment → Razorpay. Included on every page
except `passport-photo.html` (which keeps its own inline copy).

- On load, if `passport-photo.html`'s `#plansModal` / `window.openPlans`
  already exist, pricing.js steps aside (no double-modal).
- Exposes `window.openPlans` and `window.startCheckout` globally.
- `assets/auth.js` Upgrade/Change Plan button calls `window.openPlans()`
  on the current page instead of redirecting to `passport-photo.html#plans`.
- If `window.Razorpay` SDK isn't loaded, falls back to navigating to
  `passport-photo.html#buy-<planId>`.
- Hash handling: `#pricing` / `#plans` opens plan picker; `#buy-<planId>`
  goes straight to checkout.

Include order on each page:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/pricing.css">
<script src="assets/pricing.js" defer></script>
<!-- AFTER auth.js so window.currentUser / window.openAuth are available -->
```

## 8. Communication style (quota-conscious)

- **Hinglish, zero jargon.** The project owner has explicitly said
  "muje coding ke baare main kuch nhi pta hai" — assume the reader does
  not know code, stack traces, network tooling, or CI/CD. Translate
  every technical finding into plain consequences: kya toota, kya kaam
  kar raha hai, kya decision chahiye.
- **Never paste** stack traces, CDP initiator dumps, Playwright logs,
  minified JS snippets, HTTP status codes, or internal symbol names in
  user messages. Keep that evidence in the PR body / commit message
  only.
- **Lead with the decision, not the investigation.** First line should
  tell the user what's fixed / what's broken / what choice they need to
  make. Details only if asked.
- **Short plan → get approval → implement.** One PR per logical task.
- **Concise updates only** — don't message after every tool call.
- Before reporting done: `npm run build` locally.
- Keep backend / CI / CD internals brief unless asked.
- **Quota-conscious:** the owner watches daily quota. If they flag it
  mid-task, drop to the most terse mode possible — fewer tool calls,
  no speculative exploration, no re-explaining already-agreed plans.

## 9. Known issues from the 2026-04-23 full-site audit

See `issues.md` at the repo root for the full findings table. This skill
just lists what's closed and what's still open so the next session
doesn't re-fix already-merged work.

**Open backlog (default priority order for next session):**

*Functional nits:* `F6` audience grid sparse, `F7` GSI iframe warnings
(harmless, not our code), `F11` passport-photo 1440 empty space
(passport-photo edit, minimum-diff).

*2026 polish roadmap (by impact):*
1. `P12` Pricing comparison matrix.
2. `P30` Homepage density break — live-demo section between HERO/FEATURES.
3. `P24` Self-host Syne + DM Mono (woff2 subset).
4. `P16` Language switcher UI affordance.
5. `P26` Cookie banner (self-hosted, essentials-only).

*Responsive items — only low-priority nits remain:*
- `R4` passport-photo upload-card frame-corners clip at iPhone SE (low priority).
- `R7` No dedicated 768 px hero breakpoint (optional polish).

*Passport-photo-specific backlog* (file is no longer locked, but still
requires minimum-diff care — see Hard rule #1): `F11` 1440 empty space,
`P20` AI-model download progress bar, `P21` inline error banner,
`P29` step-bar progress fill, `R4` frame-corners clip at 375 px.

**How to audit again (reproducible)**

```bash
# 3 viewports × 8 pages via Playwright, ~30 s.
mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/audit-evidence
# See the script committed to issues.md's reference section; run:
python3 -c "import playwright" || pip install playwright && playwright install chromium
# Then adapt the PAGES/VIEWPORTS list in your script and iterate.
```

When auditing: check `audit.json` for `hasHScroll`, `brokenImages`,
`consoleErrors`, `netErrors`. Per-page `logs/<page>__<viewport>.json`
has full console + network.

## 10. Related repos

- Frontend (this repo): `loginfaster89-wq/passportprint`
- Backend: `loginfaster89-wq/PassportPrint-Studio` — Node/Express on
  Render. Handles auth (email OTP + Google), Razorpay, `/api/me`,
  `/api/google-login`, `/api/delete-account`. URL hardcoded as
  `https://passportprint-studio.onrender.com` in `passport-photo.html`
  and `assets/auth.js`.

## 11. Ready-to-paste prompt for a new Devin chat

Copy the block below into a fresh Devin session when you want to hand
off the responsive + pricing-flow follow-up work. It self-contains
repo / PAT / rules / concrete scope and references `issues.md` §D for
details, so a new session can start working without re-auditing.

```
Studio Print frontend par kaam karo.
Repo: loginfaster89-wq/passportprint (private)
PAT: GITHUB_PAT_PASSPORTPRINT (repo-scoped fine-grained secret —
Contents + Pull requests: Read and write on this repo).

Clone ke baad pehle ye teen files padho:
1. .agents/skills/studioprint/SKILL.md — Devin-specific recipe
   (build/preview, hard rules, PAT curl snippet, Hinglish style,
   §7b pricing module, §9 closed/open backlog).
2. AGENTS.md — full source of truth.
3. issues.md — 2026-04-23 full-site audit + 2026-04-24 §D responsive
   follow-up. All R-series / U-series items are shipped (PRs #108–#114).

## Architecture context (shipped — don't redo)

- **Shared pricing modal** (`assets/pricing.js` + `assets/pricing.css`,
  PR #114): 2-step Choose Plan → Complete Payment → Razorpay. Included
  on every page except `passport-photo.html` (which keeps its inline
  copy). `window.openPlans` / `window.startCheckout` exposed globally.
- **Auth.js Upgrade button** now calls `window.openPlans()` on the
  current page instead of redirecting to `passport-photo.html#plans`.
- **Homepage inline checkout** (PR #112): pricing CTAs open Razorpay
  directly without page navigation.
- **`passport-photo.html`** unlocked (PR #110) — editable with minimum
  diff. Has `#plans` / `#buy-<planId>` hash-open script and inline
  copies of nav/auth.

## Open backlog — pick one per session

1. `P12` — Pricing comparison matrix (Free vs Weekly vs Monthly table).
2. `P30` — Homepage density break — live-demo section.
3. `P24` — Self-host Syne + DM Mono (woff2 subset).
4. `P16` — Language switcher UI affordance.
5. `P26` — Cookie banner (self-hosted, essentials-only).

Passport-photo nits: `F11` 1440 empty space, `P20` AI-model progress
bar, `P21` inline error banner, `P29` step-bar fill, `R4` frame-corners
375 px.

## Default rules (same every session)
- `passport-photo.html` editable (2026-04-24 unlock), minimum diff.
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` mat chhedo.
- Fonts / palette / CSS tokens unchanged.
- One PR per logical task, minimum diff.
- `npm run build` run karke verify karo.
- Hinglish updates, quota-conscious, zero jargon.
```
